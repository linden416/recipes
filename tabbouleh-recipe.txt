	1/4 fresh squeezed lemons (2)

	1 cup minced scallions white and green parts
	2 cups finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (from 3 bunches)
	1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mint
	2 medium tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
	1 seedless cucumber*, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4-inch pieces

	3 teaspoons salt
	1 teaspoon black pepper

1. 	Place the bulghur in a large bowl, pour in the boiling water. Add lemon juice, olive oil, and salt.
	Stir then stand at room temp for an hour. [Drain excess liquid]

2.	Add the scallions, parsley, cucumber, tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste.
